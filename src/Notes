Creational design patterns -creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code
1. Singleton Pattern- Ensure only one object is created
2. Factory(Abstract) Pattern - Creates objects
3. Builder pattern - Create immutable objects using object builder. Avoid creation of telescoping constructors for default/optional vaues
4. Prototype Pattern - Create copy/clone of object

Behavioural Design Patterns -identify common communication patterns between objects. These patterns increase flexibility in carrying out the communication.
1. strategy pattern

   observer pattern

   command pattern

   template pattern

   visitor pattern

   null object and the iterator patterns-
